# Rust Basics

Why Rust? Who uses it? Some Hisotry

## Basic Syntax

Variables, Tuples, Functions, Blocks, Keywords (let, mut...), Macros

## Structs

Struct syntax, Tuple structs, unit-like structs

## Methods

Methods of structs

## Traits

traits are like interfaces (C++, Java), how do they add to safety?

# Memory Safety

What is it and how does rust guarantee it? (borrowing, ownership), comparison to other languages

## Borrowing and Ownership

Lifetime in Structs, Functions, ...

## Smart pointers

Box<T>, Rc<T>, Arc<T>

RefCell<T>?

## Threads

Closures, ownership in threads

# Type Safety 

What is it and how does rust guarantee it? (bound check at compile time, other checks at compile time), comparison to other languages
